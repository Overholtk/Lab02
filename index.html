            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kaya, and my pronouns are they/them. I was born in Sammamish, a suburb about an hour east of Seattle give or take traffic, and moved to several cities around Washington after graduating high school. Immediately after graduation I was studying musical theatre, and then migrated to physics after finding I didn't quite fit the culture of a college theatre department. I enjoy playing animal crossing, cooking new recipes, and crafting in my spare time, as well as reading books about plants, fungi, and space.</p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            </p>I graduated from Eastlake High School and have attended several community colleges since due to moving 
            around Washington. Before coming to Codefellows, I was attending Whatcom Community College persuing a physics transfer degree.</p>
            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
            <p>My work has primarily been in the service industry at both starbucks and a local grocery. Additionally I have had two jobs as a professional dungeon master for dungeons and dragons. (Editions 3.5 and 5)</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>After graduating codefellows I would like to get a job in industry, and finish putting myself through school. Eventually I would like to work in physics research, ideally looking at quantum physics and related subjects.</p>
