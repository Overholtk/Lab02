            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kaya, and my pronouns are they/them. I was born in Sammamish, a suburb about an hour east of Seattle give or take traffic, and moved to several cities around Washington after graduating high school. Immediately after graduation I was studying musical theatre, and then migrated to physics after finding I didn't quite fit the culture of a college theatre department. I enjoy playing animal crossing, cooking new recipes, and crafting in my spare time, as well as reading books about plants, fungi, and space.</p>
